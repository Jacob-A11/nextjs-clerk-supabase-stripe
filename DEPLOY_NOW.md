# 🚀 Deploy LetsReWise to Vercel NOW - Step by Step

## ✅ Prerequisites Complete

- ✅ Code pushed to GitHub: [repository-name]
- ✅ Landing page ready and tested
- ✅ Vercel configuration added
- ✅ Environment variables documented

## 📋 Deployment Steps (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Go to Vercel

Open your browser and go to: **https://vercel.com**

### Step 2: Sign In / Sign Up

- If you have a Vercel account: Click "Login"
- If you don't: Click "Sign Up" (use your GitHub account for easy integration)

### Step 3: Create New Project

1. Click **"Add New..."** button (top right)
2. Select **"Project"**
3. You'll see "Import Git Repository" page

### Step 4: Import GitHub Repository

1. If this is your first time:
   - Click "Continue with GitHub"
   - Authorize Vercel to access your GitHub account
   
2. Find your repository:
   - Search for: `letsrewise`
   - Or scroll to find your repository
   
3. Click **"Import"** next to the repository

### Step 5: Configure Project

Vercel will auto-detect Next.js settings:

**Project Name:** `letsrewise` (or choose custom name)

**Framework Preset:** Next.js (auto-detected) ✅

**Root Directory:** `./` (leave as is)

**Build Settings:**
- Build Command: `pnpm build` (auto-detected) ✅
- Output Directory: `.next` (auto-detected) ✅
- Install Command: `pnpm install` (auto-detected) ✅

### Step 6: Environment Variables (OPTIONAL for now)

**For minimal deployment (landing page only):**
- Skip this step - click "Deploy" directly
- Landing page will work perfectly without any environment variables
- You can add them later

**For full functionality (later):**
- Click "Environment Variables"
- Add Clerk keys (see `.env.example` in repository)
- Add other services as needed

### Step 7: Deploy!

1. Click **"Deploy"** button
2. Wait 2-3 minutes while Vercel:
   - Installs dependencies
   - Builds your Next.js app
   - Deploys to global CDN
   
3. Watch the build logs (optional but cool to see)

### Step 8: Success! 🎉

When deployment completes, you'll see:

- ✅ **Deployment successful** message
- 🌐 Your live URL: `https://letsrewise.vercel.app` (or similar)
